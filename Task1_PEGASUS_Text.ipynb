hypertension, who presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset severe headache, nausea, and blurred vision. He reported no history of trauma, recent illnesses, or similar symptoms in the past. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15. His blood pressure was elevated at 170/100 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.\n","\n","Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, but fundoscopic examination showed bilateral papilledema. A non-contrast CT scan of the head was performed, revealing a large intracerebral hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe with surrounding edema and mass effect. The patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.\n","\n","During his ICU stay, the patient's blood pressure was aggressively managed with intravenous antihypertensive medications to maintain systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg. Neurosurgical consultation was obtained, but surgical intervention was deemed high-risk due to the size and location of the hemorrhage. He was started on a strict glucose control protocol for his diabetes and received prophylactic antiepileptic medication.\n","\n","Over the next few days, the patient's neurological status gradually improved, with resolution of headache and improvement in visual symptoms. Follow-up imaging with MRI confirmed stabilization of the hemorrhage and reduction in perilesional edema. He was transferred to the neurological ward for further recovery and rehabilitation.\n","\n","Before discharge, the patient underwent extensive counseling regarding stroke risk factors, including smoking cessation, weight loss, and adherence to antihypertensive and diabetic medications. He was discharged home on hospital day 10 with a tapering course of antiepileptic medication and instructions for outpatient follow-up with the neurology team.\n","\n","He was advised to avoid strenuous activities and alcohol consumption for the next few weeks and to monitor his blood pressure and blood glucose levels closely. The patient and his family were educated on recognizing signs of stroke recurrence and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsened.\n","\n","\"\"\"\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qpYcAYiVVAD8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728999473715,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":462,"user":{"displayName":"Tanvi Rane","userId":"13606426975014637403"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Tokenize the input text\n","inputs = tokenizer(medical_note, truncation=True, padding=\"longest\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1GXn4FcpPofg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728999476802,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":557,"user":{"displayName":"Tanvi Rane","userId":"13606426975014637403"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Generate the summary\n","summary_ids = model.generate(inputs[\"input_ids\"], max_length=50, num_beams=4, length_penalty=2.0, early_stopping=True)\n","\n","# Decode the generated summary\n","summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n","\n","# Output the summary\n","print(\"Summary:\", summary)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"pLpreIWqPoho","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728999499905,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":21827,"user":{"displayName":"Tanvi Rane","userId":"13606426975014637403"}},"outputId":"ea3c4500-db1e-4fcf-e31c-93651f89159b"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Summary: During his ICU stay, the patient's blood pressure was aggressively managed with intravenous antihypertensive medications to maintain systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg.
